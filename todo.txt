2. Infinite commands, possibly save each one as it comes in?
3. Add extra stats for NPCs (buffs, dmg resist etc.)
4. Improve passages (fake destinations etc.)
5. Improve parser grammer, multiple words for objects (e.g. gold key, silver key)
6. Save by storing commands (need to implement consistent randomness) (new branch)

Current commit:
- Fixed inventory listing
- Consistent randomness, and saved seed
- Each command stored one-by-one, removing the limit on commands
