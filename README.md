# c-text-game

Inspired by [How to program a text adventure in C](https://helderman.github.io/htpataic/htpataic01.html) by Ruud Helderman.
I used this tutorial as an example, following the main structure, although almost all of the code is written by me. However, the parser is very similar to the tutorial, as I followed this section very closely.
